#1
def a():
    return 5
print(a())

it will return the value of the function which is 5

#2
def a():
    return 5
print(a()+a())

it will print the sum of the functions which is 5+5 

#3
def a():
    return 5
    return 10
print(a())

it will print the first return which is 5

#4
def a():
    return 5
    print(10)
print(a())
 
it will print the return of what value we have in the function which is 5

#5
def a():
    print(5)
x = a()
print(x)

it will print 5 because its the value of the function a 


#6
def a(b,c):
    print(b+c)
print(a(1,2) + a(2,3))

it will print the sum of the function but they have differnt data type
the results will be 3 and 5 but there will be an error


#7
def a(b,c):
    return str(b)+str(c)
print(a(2,5))


here we used a bulit in function called str that changes any type of data to 
string even numbers 

so the results of this function will be 25 as a string 

#8
def a():
    b = 100
    print(b)
    if b < 10:
        return 5
    else:
        return 10
    return 7
print(a())

at first it will prent b then it will go to the if statment 
if the b variable is smaller than 10 then it must return 5 else it will return 10

so the finnal results will be 
100 
10


#9
def a(b,c):
    if b<c:
        return 7
    else:
        return 14
    return 3
print(a(2,3))
print(a(5,3))
print(a(2,3) + a(5,3))

the first print will be the results of the function and the if statment inside it
2 is less than 3 so it will reutrn 7 
second print will go through the same  5 is less than 3? no so it will return 14
third prind will sum the results of the two functions we have in the print 
so 2 is less than 3 so it has 7 and 5 is more than 3 so it will print 14 
we should sum them because they all numbers so the results will be 21


#10
def a(b,c):
    return b+c
    return 10
print(a(3,5))


it will print only the first return of the function so the results will be 8




#11
b = 500
print(b)
def a():
    b = 300
    print(b)
print(b)
a()
print(b)


here it will first print the second line of the code which is print(b) which is 500
then we have a function that has a value of b then it will prent it
"it wasnt called so nothing happens" 
then we go to line 6 and b will be print again by the first var value 
then the function a was called so it will be printed as 300
then on line 8 var b were called to be print so the 
results will be
		500 
		500
		300
		500

#12
b = 500
print(b)
def a():
    b = 300
    print(b)
    return b
print(b)
a()
print(b)

the same results as before(the return b in the a function wont be shown in the results)

#13
b = 500
print(b)
def a():
    b = 300
    print(b)
    return b
print(b)
b=a()
print(b)

same as before but in line 8 b value were changed to be the results of the fumction
so it will be 300
and in line 9 it will be 300
so the results will be 
500
500
300
300

#14
def a():
    print(1)
    b()
    print(2)
def b():
    print(3)
a()



here we called the function a in line 7 
in function a we have to print 1 then print function b which is print 3 then in a
we have print 2 so the results will be 1 3 2 


#15
def a():
    print(1)
    x = b()
    print(x)
    return 10
def b():
    print(3)
    return 5
y = a()
print(y)

we have function a in it we have to print 1 then print x as function b
function b has print 3 and return 5 and it will print 3  first and then it will
return the 5 from function b then 10 from function a in we have 
a variable called y which is equal function a and in the last line y was called
so the results will be 1 3 5 10
